**Abstract**


A map is a graph that admits an orientation of its edges so
that each vertex has out-degree exactly 1. We characterize graphs
which admit a decomposition into k edge-disjoint maps after: (1)
the addition of any ℓ edges; (2) the addition of some ℓ edges. These
graphs are identified with classes of sparse graphs; the results are
also given in matroidal terms.

### 1 Introduction and related work


Let G = (V, E) be a graph with n vertices and m edges. In this paper,
graphs are multigraphs, possibly containing loops. For a subset V _[′]_ _⊂_ _V,_
we use the notation E(V _[′]) to denote the edges spanned by V_ _[′]; similarly,_
_V (E[′]) denotes the vertex set spanned by E[′]._
A graph G = (V, E) is (k, ℓ)-sparse, or simply sparse,[1] if no subset V _[′]_

of n[′] vertices spans more than kn[′] _−_ _ℓ_ edges; when m = kn − _ℓ, we call the_
graph tight.
Our interest in this problem stems from our prior work on pebble game
algorithms [7, 8]. The (k, ℓ)-pebble game takes as its input a graph, and

outputs tight, sparse or failure and an orientation of a sparse subgraph
of the input. We had previously considered the problem in terms of tree
decompositions, suggesting the natural range of k ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1. In, fact,
the pebble game generalizes to the range 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1. In this paper we
examine the graphs that the general pebble game characterizes.
A map is a graph that admits an orientation of its edges so that each
vertex has out-degree exactly 1. This terminology and definition is due to
Lov´asz [9]. This class of graphs is also known as the bases of the bicy**cle matroid [12] or spanning pseudoforests [2], where the equivalent**
definition of having at most one cycle per connected component is used.
Our choice of the former definition is motivated by the pebble game
algorithms. In the (k, 0)-pebble game, the output orientation of a tight
graph has out-degree exactly k for every vertex. The motivation for studying the pebble game was to have a good algorithm for recognizing sparse
and tight graphs. These compute an orientation of a sparse graph that
obeys a specific set of restrictions on the out degree of each vertex.
The focus of this paper is the class of graphs that decompose into k
edge-disjoint maps after the addition of ℓ edges; we call such a graph a
_k-map. Our goal is to extend the results on adding ℓ_ _−_ _k edges to obtain k_
edge-disjoint spanning trees [3] to the range 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ _k_ _−_ 1. A theorem of [7]
identifies the graphs recognized by the (k, ℓ)-pebble game as (k, ℓ)-sparse
graphs.
The complete graph K4 in Figure 1(a) is (2, 2)-tight; i.e., adding any
two edges to K4 we obtain a 2-map. The graphs in Figure 1(b) and Figure
1(c) are obtained by adding two edges to K4; the edges are dashed and
oriented to show a decomposition into two maps.

Figure 1: Adding any two edges to K4 results in two maps.

White and Whiteley [20] observe the matroidal properties of sparse
graphs for 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1 in the context of bar-and-joint rigidity for
frameworks embedded on surfaces [19]. In [15], Szeg˝o characterized exactly
when tight graphs exist.
We also state our results in the context of matroid truncations. If M =
(E, I) is a matroid given by its independent sets, then the truncation of
_M is the matroid (E, {E[′]_ _∈I : |E[′]| ≤_ _k}), for some nonnegative integer k._

See, e.g., [12] for a more complete treatment of the topic of truncations.
The connection between sparse graphs and decompositions into edgedisjoint spanning trees has been extensively studied. The classical results
of Tutte [18] and Nash-Williams [11] show the equivalence of (k, k)-tight
graphs and graphs that can be decomposed into k edge-disjoint spanning
trees; such a graph is called a k-arborescence. A theorem of Tay [16,
17] relates such graphs to generic rigidity of bar-and-body structures in
arbitrary dimension.
The particular case in which k = 2 and ℓ = 3 has an important application in rigidity theory: the minimally (2, 3)-sparse graphs, known as Laman
graphs, correspond to minimally generically rigid bar-and-joint frameworks
in the plane [6]. Crapo [1] showed the equivalence of Laman graphs and
those graphs that have a decomposition into 3 edge-disjoint trees such that
each vertex is incident to exactly 2 of the trees; such a decomposition is
called a 3T 2 decomposition.
Of particular relevance to our work are results of Recski [13, 14] and
Lovasz and Yemini [10], which identify Laman graphs as those that decompose into two spanning trees after doubling any edge. In [4, 5] Hendrickson
characterized Laman graphs in terms of the existence of certain bipartite
matchings. Stated in the terminology of this paper, the results of [4] show
the Laman graphs are precisely those that decompose into 2 edge-disjoint
maps after any edge is quadrupled.
The most general results linking sparse graphs to tree decompositions
are found in Haas [3], who shows the equivalence of sparsity, adding ℓ _−_ _k_
edges to obtain a k-arborescence, and ℓTk decompositions for the case
where k ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k−1. Our results provide an analog of the first equivalences
in terms of graphs which decompose into k edge-disjoint maps.
Another decomposition theorem involving sparse graphs is due to Whiteley, who proved in [19] that for the range 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ _k −_ 1, the tight graphs
are those that can be decomposed into ℓ edge-disjoint spanning trees and
_k −_ _ℓ_ edge-disjoint maps.

### 2 Our Results

Our results characterize the graphs which admit a decomposition into k
edge-disjoint maps after adding ℓ edges. Since the focus of this paper is
on the families of matroidal sparse graphs, we assume that 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1
unless otherwise stated.
First we consider the case in which we may add any ℓ edges, including
multiple edges and loops, to G. Let Kn[k,][2][k] be the complete graph on n
vertices with k loops on each vertex and edge multiplicity 2k. It is easily
seen that any sparse graph is a subgraph of Kn[k,][2][k], and we assume this in

the following discussion.

**Theorem 1. Let G = (V, E) be a graph on n vertices and kn −** _ℓ_ _edges._
_The following statements are equivalent:_

_1. G is (k, ℓ)-sparse (and therefore tight)._

_2. Adding any ℓ_ _edges from Kn[k,][2][k]_ _−_ _G to G results in a k-map._

Theorem 1 directly generalizes the characterization of Laman graphs in

[4]. It also generalizes the results of Haas [3] to the range 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ _k −_ 1.
As an application of Theorem 1 we obtain the following decomposition
result.

**Corollary 2. Let 0 ≤** _ℓ_ _≤_ _k. Let G be a graph with n vertices and kn −_ _ℓ_
_edges. The following statements are equivalent:_

_1. G is the union of ℓ_ _edge-disjoint spanning trees and k_ _−ℓ_ _edge-disjoint_
_maps._

_2. Adding any ℓ_ _edges to G results in a k-map._

We also characterize the graphs for which there are some ℓ edges that
can be added to create a k-map.

**Theorem 3. Let G = (V, E) be a graph on n vertices and kn −** _ℓ_ _edges._
_The following statements are equivalent:_

_1. G is (k, 0)-sparse._

_2. There is some set of ℓ_ _edges, which when added to G results in a_
_k-map._

Stating Theorem 3 in matroid terms, we obtain the following.

**Corollary 4. Let Nk,ℓ** _be the family of graphs G such that m = kn_ _−_ _ℓ_ _and_
_G is (k, 0)-sparse. Then Nk,ℓ_ _is the class of bases of a matroid that is a_
_truncation of the k-fold union of the bicycle matroid._

Generalizing Theorem 1 and Theorem 3 we have the following theorem.

**Theorem 5. Let G = (V, E) be a graph on n vertices and kn −** _ℓ_ _−_ _p edges_
_and let 0 ≤_ _ℓ_ + p ≤ 2k − 1. The following statements are equivalent:

_1. G is (k, ℓ)-sparse._

_2. There is some set P of p edges which when added to G results in a_
_graph G[′]_ = (V, E ∪ _P_ ), such that adding any ℓ _edges to G[′]_ _(but no_
_more than k loops per vertex) results in a k-map._

In the next section, we provide the proofs.

### 3 Proofs

The proof of Theorem 1 relies on the following lemma.

**Lemma 6. A graph G is a k-map if and only if G is (k, 0)-tight.**

_Proof. Let Bk(G) = (Vk, E, F_ ) be the bipartite graph with one vertex class
indexed by E and the other by k copies of V . The edges of Bk(G) capture
the incidence structure of G. That is, we define F = {vie : e = vw, e ∈
_E, i = 1, 2, . . ., k}; i.e., each edge vertex in B is connected to the k copies_
of its endpoints in Bk(G). Figure 2 shows K3 and B1(K3).

Figure 2: B1(K3) is shown on the right with the one copy of V at the top.
The style of line of the edges on the left matches the style of line of the
vertex in the bipartite graph corresponding to that edge.

Figure 3: B2(G) for the graph G on the left is shown on the right with the
two copies of V at the top. G is a 2-map; one possible decomposition is
indicated by the orientation of the edges and the style of arrow heads. The
matching corresponding to this decomposition is indicated in the bipartite
graph by dashed and doubled edges.

Observe that for E[′] _⊂_ _E, NBk(G)(E[′]), the neighbors of E[′]_ in Bk(G) of
_E[′], are exactly the k copies of the vertices of the subgraph spanned by E[′]_

in G. It follows that

��NBk(G)(E′)�� = k |VG(E′)| ≥|E′| (1)

holds for all E[′] _⊂_ _E if and only if G is (k, 0)-sparse._ Applying Hall’s
theorem shows that G is (k, 0)-tight if and only if Bk(G) contains a perfect
matching.
The edges matched to the ith copy of V correspond to the ith map in
the k-map, as shown for a 2-map in Figure 3. Orient each edge away from

the vertex to which it is matched. It follows that each vertex has out degree
one in the spanning subgraph matched to each copy of V as desired.

_Proof of Theorem 1. Suppose that G is tight, and let G[′]_ be the graph obtained by adding any ℓ edges to G from Kn[k,][2][k] _−_ _G. Then G[′]_ has kn edges;
moreover G[′] is (k, 0)-sparse since at most ℓ edges were added to the span of
any subset V _[′]_ of V of size at least 2. Moreover, since the added edges came
from Kn[k,][2][k], they do not violate sparsity on single-vertex subsets. It follows
from Lemma 6 that G[′] can be decomposed into k edge-disjoint maps.
For the converse, suppose that G is not tight. Since G has kn _−_ _ℓ_ edges,
_G is not sparse. It follows that G contains a subgraph H = (V_ _[′], E[′]) such_
that |E[′]| ≥ _k |V_ _[′]| −_ _ℓ_ + 1. Add ℓ edges to the span of V _[′]_ to form G[′]. By
construction G[′] is not (k, 0)-sparse; V _[′]_ spans at least k |V _[′]|_ +1 edges in G[′].
Applying Lemma 6 shows that G[′] is not a k-map.

_Proof of Corollary 2. The equivalence of tight graphs for 0 ≤_ _ℓ_ _≤_ _k and the_
existence of a decomposition into ℓ edge-disjoint spanning trees and (k − _ℓ)_
edge-disjoint maps is shown in [19]. By Theorem 1, the tight graphs are
exactly those that decompose into k edge-disjoint maps after adding any ℓ
edges.

_Proof of Theorem 3. By hypothesis, G is (k, 0)-sparse but not tight. By a_
structure theorem of [7], G contains a single maximal subgraph H that is
(k, 0)-tight. It follows that any edge with at least one end in V − _V (H)_
may be added to G without violating sparsity. Adding ℓ edges inductively
produces a tight graph G[′] as desired. Apply Lemma 6 to complete the
proof.

_Proof of Corollary 4. Let Mk be the k-fold union of the bicycle matroid._
The bases of Mk are exactly the k-maps. Combining this with Theorem 3
shows that G ∈Nk,ℓ if and only if G is independent in Mk and |E(G)| =
_kn −_ _ℓ_ as desired.

_Proof of Theorem 5. Suppose that G is sparse._ Since G has kn − _ℓ_ _−_ _p_
edges, G does not contain a spanning (k, ℓ)-tight subgraph. Hence there
exist vertices u and v not both in the same (k, ℓ)-tight subgraph. Add
the edge uv. Inductively add p edges this way. The resulting graph G[′] is
(k, ℓ)-tight. By Theorem 1, adding any ℓ edges to G[′] results in a k-map.
Now suppose that G is not sparse. As in Theorem 1, there is no set of
edges that can be added to G to create a (k, ℓ)-tight G[′], which proves the
converse.

### 4 Conclusions and open problems

We characterize the graphs for which adding ℓ edges results in a k-map.
These results are an analog to those of Haas [3] using k-maps as the primary
object of study. In this setting, we obtain a uniform characterization of the
tight graphs for all the matroidal values of ℓ. Figure 4 compares our results
to other characterizations of sparse graphs. In this paper we extend the
results of [3] to a larger range of ℓ. While we do not have an analog of ℓTk
decompositions for the new 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ _k_ _−1 range, we do show the equivalence_
of adding ℓ edges and the existence of a decomposition into maps and trees.

In [3], there are two additional types of results: inductive sequences for
the sparse graphs and the ℓTk decompositions. Describing an analog of
_ℓTk decompositions for the maps-and-trees range of ℓ_ is an open problem.
Lee and Streinu describe inductive sequences based on the pebble game
for all the sparse graphs in [7], but these do not give the explicit decomposition shown to exist in Corollary 2. Providing this decomposition explicitly
with an inductive sequence, as opposed to algorithmically as in [2], is another open problem. The theorem of [19] used in the proof of Corollary 2
is formulated in the setting of matroid rank function and does not describe
the decomposition.
