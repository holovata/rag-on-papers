How do the concepts of (k, ℓ)-sparse graphs and edge-disjoint decompositions relate to the structure of Laman graphs and their applications in rigidity theory?

Content: See, e.g., [12] for a more complete treatment of the topic of truncations.
The connection between sparse graphs and decompositions into edgedisjoint spanning trees has been extensively studied. The classical results
of Tutte [18] and Nash-Williams [11] show the equivalence of (k, k)-tight
graphs and graphs that can be decomposed into k edge-disjoint spanning
trees; such a graph is called a k-arborescence. A theorem of Tay [16,
17] relates such graphs to generic rigidity of bar-and-body structures in
arbitrary dimension.
The particular case in which k = 2 and ℓ = 3 has an important application in rigidity theory: the minimally (2, 3)-sparse graphs, known as Laman
graphs, correspond to minimally generically rigid bar-and-joint frameworks
in the plane [6]. Crapo [1] showed the equivalence of Laman graphs and
those graphs that have a decomposition into 3 edge-disjoint trees such that
each vertex is incident to exactly 2 of the trees; such a decomposition is
called a 3T 2 decomposition.

Content: ### 2 Our Results

Our results characterize the graphs which admit a decomposition into k
edge-disjoint maps after adding ℓ edges. Since the focus of this paper is
on the families of matroidal sparse graphs, we assume that 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1
unless otherwise stated.
First we consider the case in which we may add any ℓ edges, including
multiple edges and loops, to G. Let Kn[k,][2][k] be the complete graph on n
vertices with k loops on each vertex and edge multiplicity 2k. It is easily
seen that any sparse graph is a subgraph of Kn[k,][2][k], and we assume this in

Content: _1.1. Sparse graphs_

A graph is (k,ℓ)-sparse if for any non-empty subgraph with m[′] edges and n[′] vertices, m[′] _≤_
_kn[′]_ _−_ _ℓ. We observe that this condition implies that 0 ≤_ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1, and from now on in this
paper we will make this assumption. A sparse graph that has n vertices and exactly kn _−_ _ℓ_ edges
is called tight.
For a graph G = (V, _E), and V_ _[′]_ _⊂_ _V_, we use the notation span(V _[′]) for the number of edges_
in the subgraph induced by V _[′]. In a directed graph, out(V_ _[′]) is the number of edges with the tail_
in V _[′]_ and the head in V −V _[′]; for a subgraph induced by V_ _[′], we call such an edge an out-edge._
There are two important types of subgraphs of sparse graphs. A block is a tight subgraph of
a sparse graph. A component is a maximal block.
Table 1 summarizes the sparse graph terminology used in this paper.

_1.2. Sparsity-certifying decompositions_

=== ANSWER ===
The concepts of (k, ℓ)-sparse graphs and edge-disjoint decompositions are closely related to the structure of Laman graphs and their applications in rigidity theory.

Laman graphs are a specific type of (k, ℓ)-sparse graph that corresponds to minimally generically rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane. These graphs have been extensively studied in the context of rigidity theory, particularly in relation to the characterization of generic rigidity of bar-and-body structures in arbitrary dimension.

The connection between sparse graphs and decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees has been extensively studied. The classical results of Tutte [18] and Nash-Williams [11] show that (k, k)-tight graphs are equivalent to graphs that can be decomposed into k edge-disjoint spanning trees, known as k-arborescences.

The particular case in which k = 2 and ℓ = 3 has an important application in rigidity theory. The minimally (2, 3)-sparse graphs, known as Laman graphs, correspond to minimally generically rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane [6]. Crapo [1] showed that these graphs are equivalent to those graphs that have a decomposition into 3 edge-disjoint trees such that each vertex is incident to exactly 2 of the trees; this decomposition is called a 3T 2 decomposition.

Theorem 1, which generalizes the characterization of Laman graphs in [4], also generalizes the results of Haas [3] to the range 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ k − 1. This theorem provides a characterization of (k, ℓ)-sparse graphs and their relation to edge-disjoint decompositions.

Corollary 2 states that for a graph G with n vertices and kn − ℓ edges, the following statements are equivalent:

1. G is the union of ℓ edge-disjoint spanning trees and k − ℓ edge-disjoint maps.
2. Adding any ℓ edges to G results in a k-map.

This corollary provides a characterization of graphs that can be decomposed into edge-disjoint maps after adding ℓ edges, which is relevant to the study of sparsity-certifying decompositions.

Theorem 3 characterizes the graphs for which there are some ℓ edges that can be added to create a k-map. This theorem provides a characterization of (k, 0)-sparse graphs and their relation to edge-disjoint decompositions.

In summary, the concepts of (k, ℓ)-sparse graphs and edge-disjoint decompositions are closely related to the structure of Laman graphs and their applications in rigidity theory. Theorems 1, 2, and 3 provide characterizations of these graphs and their relation to edge-disjoint decompositions, which have important implications for the study of sparsity-certifying decompositions.
