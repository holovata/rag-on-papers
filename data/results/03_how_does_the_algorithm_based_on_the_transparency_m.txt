The algorithm consists of a sequence of contraction operations in a preferred way (causing replacement of maximum number of non-units by units) so that these contractions will lead to formation of complete graph of largest possible size (the size of the complete graph that results will be largest if it is achieved in minimum number of steps, i.e. minimum number of contraction operations).

The four color problem first appeared in a letter of October 23, 1852 to Sir William Hamilton from Augustus de Morgan, which was asked to him by his student Frederick Guthrie who later attributed it to his brother Francis Guthrie.                After the announcement of this problem to the London Mathematical Society by Arthur Cayley in 1878, within a year its solution was proposed by Kempe [2]. One year after this publication Heawood published its refutation [3]. But Kemp’s idea of alternating paths actually led to the correct solution of this problem in the hands of Appel and Haken, obtained by making heavy use of computer [4].

=== ANSWER ===
The algorithm based on the transparency matrix proposed for Hadwiger's Conjecture connects to edge contraction methods in structural graph transformations by utilizing the properties of the transparency matrix to guide the sequence of contractions. The transparency matrix, T(G), is defined as a p × p matrix where each element a_{ij} represents the length of the shortest path joining vertices v_i and v_j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ p) in the graph G (Source: 0705.0100.md, chunk 2).

The contraction algorithm involves replacing elements a_{ij} with min{a_{ij}, a_{ki}} for k ≠ j and replacing elements a_{kj} with min{a_{kj}, a_{ik}} for k ≠ i (Source: 0705.0100.md, chunk 1). This process effectively reduces the graph to a complete graph of largest possible size through a sequence of well-defined contraction operations.

The key insight here is that the transparency matrix provides a way to search for a minimal-partite-representation for a given graph, which is essential for proving Hadwiger's Conjecture. By iteratively applying the contraction algorithm and updating the transparency matrix, we can identify the optimal sequence of contractions that leads to the formation of a complete graph of largest possible size.

In particular, the algorithm terminates when all off-diagonal elements of T(G) become units (Source: 0705.0100.md, chunk 23). This termination condition ensures that the algorithm will eventually produce a complete graph, which is the desired outcome for Hadwiger's Conjecture.

The connection to edge contraction methods in structural graph transformations lies in the fact that each contraction operation corresponds to identifying two adjacent vertices and replacing them with a single vertex (Source: 0705.0100.md, chunk 19). By iteratively applying these contractions, we can transform the original graph into a complete graph of largest possible size.

Overall, the algorithm based on the transparency matrix provides a powerful tool for proving Hadwiger's Conjecture and has connections to edge contraction methods in structural graph transformations.
