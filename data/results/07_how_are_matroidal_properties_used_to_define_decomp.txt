=== ANSWER ===
The concept of matroidal properties plays a crucial role in defining decompositions into spanning trees or maps, and its implications for graph rigidity are significant.

In the context of graph decomposition, a matroid is a mathematical structure that generalizes the notion of an independent set. A sparse graph G is said to be tight if it has exactly kn−ℓ edges, where n is the number of vertices and k is the arboricity (the minimum number of forests needed to cover all edges). The decomposition problem for sparse graphs involves finding a decomposition that can be used to certify sparsity.

One type of decomposition is the (k, ℓ)-maps-and-trees decomposition, which consists of an edge-disjoint union of ℓ trees and (k − ℓ) map-graphs. This decomposition is related to matroid unions, as shown by Edmonds [3, 4] using a proof involving matroid unions.

Another type of decomposition is the proper ℓTk decomposition, where every vertex subset V ′ contains at least ℓ pieces of trees from the ℓTk. This decomposition is also related to matroids and has been studied in the context of graph rigidity.

The matroidal properties of sparse graphs are also relevant to the study of graph rigidity. In particular, White and Whiteley [20] observe that tight graphs exist if and only if certain matroidal conditions are satisfied. Additionally, Szeg˝o [15] characterized exactly when tight graphs exist in terms of matroid truncations.

The implications of these results for graph rigidity are significant. For example, Laman's foundational theorem shows that (2, 3)-tight graphs correspond to generically minimally rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane. This result can be understood using matroid unions and the properties of maps-and-trees decompositions.

In summary, the concept of matroidal properties plays a crucial role in defining decompositions into spanning trees or maps, and its implications for graph rigidity are significant. The study of these decompositions and their relationships to matroids has important consequences for our understanding of graph rigidity and its applications in various fields.
