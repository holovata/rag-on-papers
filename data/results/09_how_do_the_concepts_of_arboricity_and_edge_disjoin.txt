=== ANSWER ===
The concepts of arboricity and edge-disjoint tree decompositions generalize to k-map constructions in sparse graph theory by considering the properties of k-arborescent graphs and map-graphs.

A k-arborescence is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint spanning trees, which are also known as (k, k)-tight graphs (Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17]). This concept can be extended to k-map constructions, where a k-map-graph is a graph that admits an orientation such that the out-degree of each vertex is exactly one. The edges in a k-map-graph are oriented in one possible configuration, certifying that each color forms a map-graph (Figure 1(b)).

The connection between sparse graphs and decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees has been extensively studied. For the case where k ≤ ℓ ≤ 2k−1, the results provide an analog of the first equivalences in terms of graphs which decompose into k edge-disjoint maps (0704.3843.md, chunk 8). Another decomposition theorem involving sparse graphs is due to Whiteley, who proved that for the range 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ k − 1, the tight graphs are those that can be decomposed into ℓ edge-disjoint spanning trees and k−ℓ edge-disjoint maps (Whiteley [19]).

The concept of arboricity also plays a role in the study of sparse graphs. Haas [7] characterized the arboricity of graphs, which is the minimum number of edges required to partition the graph into k edge-disjoint spanning trees. This characterization has implications for the study of map decompositions and k-map constructions.

In addition, Crapo [1] showed the equivalence of Laman graphs (which correspond to minimally (2, 3)-sparse graphs) and those graphs that have a decomposition into 3 edge-disjoint trees such that each vertex is incident to exactly 2 of the trees; such a decomposition is called a 3T2 decomposition. This result highlights the importance of studying sparse graphs and their decompositions in various fields.

In summary, the concepts of arboricity and edge-disjoint tree decompositions generalize to k-map constructions in sparse graph theory by considering the properties of k-arborescent graphs and map-graphs. The study of these concepts has implications for the understanding of sparse graphs and their decompositions, with applications in rigidity theory and other fields.
