Edmonds [3, 4] gave another proof of this result using matroid unions. The equivalence of mapsand-trees graphs and tight graphs in the lower range is shown using matroid unions in [24], and
matroid augmenting paths are the basis of the algorithms for the lower range of [5, 6, 19].

Content: _The decomposition problem._ We define the decomposition problem for sparse graphs as taking a graph as its input and producing as output, a decomposition that can be used to certify sparsity. In this paper, we will study three kinds of outputs: maps-and-trees; proper ℓTk decompositions;
and the pebble-game-with-colors decomposition, which is defined in the next section.

**2. Historical background**

The well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] relate the (k, _k)-tight graphs to_
the existence of decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees. Taking a matroidal viewpoint,

White and Whiteley [20] observe the matroidal properties of sparse
graphs for 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1 in the context of bar-and-joint rigidity for
frameworks embedded on surfaces [19]. In [15], Szeg˝o characterized exactly
when tight graphs exist.
We also state our results in the context of matroid truncations. If M =
(E, I) is a matroid given by its independent sets, then the truncation of
_M is the matroid (E, {E[′]_ _∈I : |E[′]| ≤_ _k}), for some nonnegative integer k._

=== ANSWER ===
Based on the provided context, I can answer the question as follows:

Matroidal properties are used to define decompositions into spanning trees or maps by considering the matroid union of independent sets. This approach is related to the concept of map-graphs, which are graphs that admit an out-degree-exactly-one orientation.

The implications for graph rigidity include the fact that (2, 3)-tight graphs correspond to generically minimally rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane, as shown by Laman's theorem. This suggests that matroidal properties can be used to study the rigidity of graphs and their potential applications in fields like computer science and engineering.
