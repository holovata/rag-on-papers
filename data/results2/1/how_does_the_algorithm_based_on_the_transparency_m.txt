                It is clear that the above discussed algorithm will definitely terminate in finitely many steps, terminating into formation of a complete graph. The algorithm consists of a sequence of contraction operations in a preferred way (causing replacement of maximum number of non-units by units) so that these contractions will lead to formation of complete graph of largest possible size (the size of the complete graph that results will be largest if it is achieved in minimum number of steps, i.e. minimum number of contraction operations).

Content: #### We propose an algorithm to reduce a k-chromatic graph to a complete graph of largest possible order through a well defined sequence of contractions. We introduce a new matrix called transparency matrix and state its properties. We then define correct contraction procedure to be executed to get largest possible complete graph from given connected graph. We finally give a characterization for k-chromatic graph and use it to settle Hadwigers conjecture.

#### 4. Transparency Matrix: Now, the immediate question that arises is the following: How one can search, in a simplest possible way, for a minimal-partite-representation for given graph? We now define a new matrix called transparency matrix and study its properties. We will see that these properties can be very useful for one’s search for a proof of the Hadwiger’s conjecture.

Content: #### this conjecture is equivalent to the famous “Four color problem”.                 The four color problem first appeared in a letter of October 23, 1852 to Sir William Hamilton from Augustus de Morgan, which was asked to him by his student Frederick Guthrie who later attributed it to his brother Francis Guthrie.                After the announcement of this problem to the London Mathematical Society by Arthur Cayley in 1878, within a year its solution was proposed by Kempe [2]. One year after this publication Heawood published its refutation [3]. But Kemp’s idea of alternating paths actually led to the correct solution of this problem in the hands of Appel and Haken, obtained by making heavy use of computer [4]. Before we proceed to discuss the notion of transparency matrix and algorithm that leads to a complete graph of largest size through a sequence of well defined contraction operations which we think will be very useful for Hadwiger’s problem a brief description of some

=== ANSWER ===
Based on the provided context, I can answer the question as follows:

The algorithm based on the transparency matrix proposed for Hadwiger's Conjecture connects to the edge contraction methods in structural graph transformations by replacing all elements a, k ≠ j in the transparency matrix T(G) with min{a, } and then replacing all elements a, k ≠ j with min{a, }.

This is stated in source: 0705.0100.md (chunk 1).

Additionally, when performing a contraction operation on the graph G, the transparency matrix T(G) can be obtained from T(G[~]) by performing the following operations:

(1) Replace all elements a, k ≠ j with min{a, }.
This is stated in source: 0705.0100.md (chunk 5).

(2) Replace all elements a, k ≠ j with min{a, }.

This is also stated in source: 0705.0100.md (chunk 5).
