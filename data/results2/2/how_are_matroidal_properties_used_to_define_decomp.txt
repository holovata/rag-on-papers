Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 3

=== ANSWER ===
The matroidal properties play a crucial role in defining decompositions into spanning trees or maps, and these decompositions have significant implications for graph rigidity.

In the context of sparse graphs, a decomposition is a way to partition the edges of the graph into smaller subgraphs that can be used to certify sparsity. The three types of outputs studied in this paper are:

1. Maps-and-trees: This type of decomposition consists of an edge-disjoint union of ℓ trees and (k −ℓ) map-graphs.
2. Proper ℓTk decompositions: This type of decomposition consists of the union of ℓ trees, each vertex is in exactly k of them.
3. Pebble-game-with-colors decomposition: This type of decomposition is defined in the next section.

The matroidal properties of sparse graphs are used to define these decompositions. Specifically, a graph G is said to be sparse if every non-empty subgraph on n′ vertices has ≤kn′ −ℓ edges. A tight graph G is defined as a sparse graph with |V| = n and |E| = kn−ℓ.

The matroidal properties of sparse graphs are also used to define the concept of map-graphs, which are graphs that admit an out-degree-exactly-one orientation. Map-graphs play a crucial role in defining the maps-and-trees decompositions.

In the context of graph rigidity, the matroidal properties of sparse graphs have significant implications. Specifically, the (2, 3)-tight graphs correspond to generically minimally rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane. This result is based on the foundational theorem of Laman [11].

The equivalence of maps-and-trees graphs and tight graphs in the lower range is shown using matroid unions in [24]. Matroid augmenting paths are also used as a basis for algorithms for the lower range of [5, 6, 19].

In summary, the matroidal properties play a crucial role in defining decompositions into spanning trees or maps, and these decompositions have significant implications for graph rigidity.
