Content: Our algorithms are based on a new characterization of sparse graphs, which we call the
**pebble game with colors. The pebble game with colors is a simple graph construction rule that**
produces a sparse graph along with a sparsity-certifying decomposition.
We define and study a canonical class of pebble game constructions, which correspond to
previously studied decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our results provide
a unifying framework for all the previously known special cases, including Nash-WilliamsTutte and [7, 24]. Indeed, in the lower range, canonical pebble game constructions capture the
properties of the augmenting paths used in matroid union and intersection algorithms[5, 6].
Since the sparse graphs in the upper range are not known to be unions or intersections of the
matroids for which there are efficient augmenting path algorithms, these do not easily apply in

It follows that any sparse graph has a pebble game construction.

In this section we prove Theorem 2, which characterizes all pebble-game decompositions. We
start with the following lemmas about the structure of monochromatic connected components
in H, the directed graph maintained during the pebble game.

terization of the family of (k,ℓ)-sparse graphs and algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have
received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored pebbles generalize and strengthen
the previous results of Lee and Streinu [12] and give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the (k,ℓ)-pebble
game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between pebble game algorithms and previous
sparse graph algorithms by Gabow [5], Gabow and Westermann [6] and Hendrickson [9].


**1. Introduction and preliminaries**

Content: **Theorem 2 (The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition). A graph G is a pebble-game**
_graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs such that each_
_is (1,_ 0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ℓ _tree-pieces of the (1,_ 0)-sparse
_graphs in the decomposition._

_Proof. Let G be a pebble-game graph. The existence of the k edge-disjoint (1,_ 0)-sparse subgraphs was shown in Lemma 10, and Lemma 11 proves the condition on subgraphs.
For the other direction, we observe that a color ci with ti tree-pieces in a given subgraph can
span at most n − _ti edges; summing over all the colors shows that a graph with a pebble-game_
decomposition must be sparse. Apply Theorem 1 to complete the proof.

=== ANSWER ===
The Pebble Game Framework is used to characterize sparse graphs, and this characterization extends to k-map decompositions.

A graph G is (k,ℓ)-sparse if and only if it is a pebble-game graph, as stated in Theorem 1. This means that any (k,ℓ)-sparse graph can be represented as a pebble game graph.

The Pebble Game Framework also provides a characterization of pebble-game decompositions, which are generalizations of proper ℓTk decompositions. A graph G is a pebble-game graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs such that each is (1,0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ℓ tree-pieces of the (1,0)-sparse graphs in the decomposition.

The characterization extends to k-map decompositions. A k-map decomposition is a decomposition of a graph into k edge-disjoint subgraphs, where each subgraph has a specific structure that allows for efficient computation.

In the context of sparse graphs, the Pebble Game Framework provides a unifying framework for all previously known special cases, including Nash-WilliamsTutte and [7, 24]. The framework also captures the properties of augmenting paths used in matroid union and intersection algorithms[5, 6].

The characterization is based on the pebble game with colors construction rule, which produces a sparse graph along with a sparsity-certifying decomposition. This construction rule generalizes and strengthens previous results of Lee and Streinu [12] and gives a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity.

In summary, the Pebble Game Framework provides a characterization of sparse graphs and extends to k-map decompositions, providing a unifying framework for all previously known special cases.
