#### 3. Hadwiger’s Conjecture: Let G be a k-chromatic graph on p points and q lines, p > k. Clearly this graph will always have a minimal-partite- representation, as some k-partite graph. Because, if k is not minimum and suppose there exists subpartite-representation for G as some l-partite graph with l < k, then G will be l-chromatic, a contradiction.  In order to settle Hadwiger’s problem we essentially need to show that for a k-chromatic graph G there exists a well defined sequence of contraction operations to be carried out which will take it to

Content: #### We propose an algorithm to reduce a k-chromatic graph to a complete graph of largest possible order through a well defined sequence of contractions. We introduce a new matrix called transparency matrix and state its properties. We then define correct contraction procedure to be executed to get largest possible complete graph from given connected graph. We finally give a characterization for k-chromatic graph and use it to settle Hadwigers conjecture. 
 1. Introduction: In the year 1943 Hadwiger proposed the following conjecture [1] which states that “Every n-chromatic graph contains a subgraph contractible to K, a complete graph on n points”. For n = 5

#### We now proceed to see that it should be valid for l . But this is clear since graphs on p points, p = l + k, are either themselves k-chromatic, or are graphs which themselves could be less than k-chromatic but have arrived at by suitable contractions, in the sense of algorithm 5.1, from a graph which was k-chromatic. Such graphs must be those which must contain a suitable contraction in the sense of algorithm 5.1 which when carried out produce graphs isomorphic to some graph among the suitable graphs (to be k-chromatic) for the case with p = k + (l −)1, for if these graphs do not contain a contraction which will produce a graph isomorphic to some graph among the graphs which are suitable (for k-chromaticity) for the case of (l −)1 then G cannot be k-chromatic. 
 Theorem 5.2 (Hadwiger’s Conjecture): Every k-chromatic graph is contractible to K, a complete graph on k points.

=== ANSWER ===
The recursive contraction algorithm for Hadwiger's Conjecture relates to achieving the chromatic number via transformations of k-chromatic graphs through the concept of transparency matrix and its properties.

According to the given context (0705.0100.md, chunk 9), a k-chromatic graph G on p points can be reduced to a complete graph K with k points through a well-defined sequence of contraction operations. The transparency matrix T(G) is used to keep track of the number of contractions required to reduce the graph.

The property (8) of the transparency matrix states that every contraction reduces the size of the transparency matrix by exactly one count. This means that each contraction operation decreases the number of points in the graph by 1, effectively reducing the chromatic number.

The recursive contraction algorithm for Hadwiger's Conjecture can be seen as a process of iteratively applying contraction operations to reduce the graph until it reaches a complete graph K with k points. The transparency matrix is used to keep track of the number of contractions required at each step, and the property (8) ensures that the chromatic number decreases by 1 at each step.

In terms of achieving the chromatic number via transformations of k-chromatic graphs, the recursive contraction algorithm for Hadwiger's Conjecture provides a way to reduce any k-chromatic graph to a complete graph with k points. This is achieved through a series of contraction operations that decrease the chromatic number at each step.

The characterization of k-chromatic graphs provided in the context (0705.0100.md, chunk 1) states that every k-chromatic graph G can be reduced to K, a complete graph on k points, through a well-defined sequence of contraction operations. This characterization is based on the recursive contraction algorithm for Hadwiger's Conjecture and provides a way to settle the conjecture.

In summary, the recursive contraction algorithm for Hadwiger's Conjecture relates to achieving the chromatic number via transformations of k-chromatic graphs through the concept of transparency matrix and its properties. The algorithm provides a way to reduce any k-chromatic graph to a complete graph with k points by iteratively applying contraction operations that decrease the chromatic number at each step.
