What role do minimal separators and separability order play in determining the structure of concentration graphs from conditional independence statements?

S separates A and B in G ⇐⇒ XA ⊥⊥ XB|XS.

The aim of this paper is to prove the existence of a relationship between the cardinality
of the separators in G and the maximum number of conditioning variables needed to
determine the full conditional independencies in P . We proceed first by defining a new
parameter for undirected graphs, called the “separability order ”. Subsequently we prove
that when we condition on a fixed number of variables equal to this separability order,
the graph that is obtained is exactly the concentration graph.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the definition of this parameter and of some properties thereof. In Section 3, we will define a sequence of undirected graphs constructed due to conditional independencies for a given fixed number
k ∈{0,..., |V | − 2}. More precisely, we define the k-graph Gk = (V,Ek) by

Content: A concentration graph associated with a random vector is an undirected graph where each
vertex corresponds to one random variable in the vector. The absence of an edge between any
pair of vertices (or variables) is equivalent to full conditional independence between these two
variables given all the other variables. In the multivariate Gaussian case, the absence of an edge
corresponds to a zero coefficient in the precision matrix, which is the inverse of the covariance
matrix.
It is well known that this concentration graph represents some of the conditional independencies in the distribution of the associated random vector. These conditional independencies
correspond to the “separations” or absence of edges in that graph. In this paper we assume that
there are no other independencies present in the probability distribution than those represented
by the graph. This property is called the perfect Markovianity of the probability distribution

Content: the associated graphical model is called a concentration graph model (see Lauritzen
(1996)). Dempster (1972) studied concentration graph models for Gaussian distributions under the name of covariance selection or covariance selection models. The absence of an edge between a given pair of vertices (α,β) in the associated graph indicates that the random variable Xα is independent of Xβ given all the other variables
X−αβ = (Xγ,γ ̸= α,β)[′]. These models are very well studied, especially the ones corresponding to Gaussian distributions (see Whittaker (1990), Lauritzen (1996), Edwards
(2000) and, recently, Letac and Massam (2007) and Rajaratnam et al. (2008)). The separation criteria defined on such graphs is a simple separation criteria on undirected graphs:
S ⊆ V separates two disjoint non-empty subsets A and B of V if any path joining a vertex
in A and another in B intersects S.
Other graphical models are represented by graphs with bi-directed edges. These models

Content: concentration graph model G is equal to the k-partial graph G[p]k [as defined in (][6][) when]
k is smaller than the separability order of G, referred to in that paper as the “outer
connectivity of the missing edges”. The result in Theorem 4, however, is based on a
construction of a sequence of nested graphs. It starts from the covariance graph, that is,
G0, the 0-graph, and it becomes stationary and equal to the concentration graph when
the number of conditioning variables is equal to the separability order of the concentration
graph.
In Lemma 8, we show that k-partial graphs and k-graphs are equal when the perfect
Markovianity assumption is satisfied. Next, we give a corollary of Theorem 4. In Corollary 9 we give a condition that allows us to determine the last undirected k-graph in
the sequence of nested graphs obtained due to Theorem 4. This condition is given in
term of the degree two of the k-graphs, not as in Castello and Roverato (2006), where

=== ANSWER ===
The role of minimal separators and separability order in determining the structure of concentration graphs from conditional independence statements is a crucial aspect of the paper.

In the context of undirected graphs, a separator S separates two disjoint non-empty subsets A and B if any path joining a vertex in A and another in B intersects S. This separation criterion is used to define the separability order of a graph, which is denoted as k.

The separability order k is defined as the maximum number of conditioning variables needed to determine the full conditional independencies in P. In other words, it represents the minimum number of variables that must be conditioned on to fully capture the dependencies between all pairs of variables in the distribution.

When we condition on a fixed number of variables equal to this separability order k, the resulting graph is exactly the concentration graph. This means that the concentration graph represents the conditional independencies in the distribution when conditioning on k variables.

The paper defines a sequence of undirected graphs constructed due to conditional independencies for a given fixed number k ∈{0,..., |V | − 2}. The k-graph Gk is defined as (V,Ek) by removing edges between vertices that are conditionally independent given the other variables.

The separability order plays a crucial role in determining the structure of concentration graphs. When we condition on k variables, the resulting graph is equal to the concentration graph if and only if k is greater than or equal to the separability order.

In Lemma 8, it is shown that k-partial graphs and k-graphs are equal when the perfect Markovianity assumption is satisfied. This means that the sequence of nested graphs Gk starting from k = 0 can be terminated when the number of conditioning variables becomes greater than the degree two of the estimated graph Gk.

The separability order also plays a role in determining the last undirected k-graph in the sequence of nested graphs obtained due to Theorem 4. This condition is given in terms of the degree two of the k-graphs, not as in Castello and Roverato (2006).

In summary, the minimal separators and separability order play a crucial role in determining the structure of concentration graphs from conditional independence statements. The separability order represents the minimum number of variables needed to fully capture the dependencies between all pairs of variables in the distribution.
