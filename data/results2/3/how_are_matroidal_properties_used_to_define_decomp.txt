Edmonds [3, 4] gave another proof of this result using matroid unions. The equivalence of mapsand-trees graphs and tight graphs in the lower range is shown using matroid unions in [24], and
matroid augmenting paths are the basis of the algorithms for the lower range of [5, 6, 19].

White and Whiteley [20] observe the matroidal properties of sparse
graphs for 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1 in the context of bar-and-joint rigidity for
frameworks embedded on surfaces [19]. In [15], Szeg˝o characterized exactly

We also state our results in the context of matroid truncations. If M =

_M is the matroid (E, {E[′]_ _∈I : |E[′]| ≤_ _k}), for some nonnegative integer k._

Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 3

=== ANSWER ===
In graph theory, matroidal properties are used to define decompositions into spanning trees or maps. A matroid is a mathematical structure that generalizes the concept of an independent set in a graph.

A map-graph is a graph that admits an out-degree-exactly-one orientation, meaning that each edge has exactly one outgoing neighbor. The decomposition of a graph into (k, ℓ)-maps-and-trees involves finding a union of k trees and (ℓ) map-grapahs such that every vertex is in exactly ℓ of the trees.

The matroidal properties of sparse graphs are used to study the decomposition problem, which is defined as taking a graph as input and producing a decomposition that can be used to certify sparsity. The three kinds of outputs studied in this paper are:

1. Maps-and-trees: A decomposition into edge-disjoint union of ℓ trees and (k − ℓ) map-grapahs.
2. Proper ℓTk decompositions: A decomposition where every vertex is in exactly k of the trees, with each tree having a specific structure.
3. Pebble-game-with-colors decomposition: A different type of decomposition that uses pebbles and colors to represent the edges.

The matroidal properties of sparse graphs are also used to study graph rigidity, which refers to the ability of a framework (a set of connected vertices) to resist deformation without losing its shape. The Laman theorem states that (2, 3)-tight graphs correspond to generically minimally rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane.

In summary, matroidal properties are used to define decompositions into spanning trees or maps, and these decompositions have implications for graph rigidity. The study of these decompositions is an active area of research in graph theory and combinatorial optimization.
