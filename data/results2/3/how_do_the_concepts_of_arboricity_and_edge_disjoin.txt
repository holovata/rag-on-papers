How do the concepts of arboricity and edge-disjoint tree decompositions generalize to k-map constructions in sparse graph theory?

Content: edges to obtain a k-arborescence, and ℓTk decompositions for the case
where k ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k−1. Our results provide an analog of the first equivalences
in terms of graphs which decompose into k edge-disjoint maps.
Another decomposition theorem involving sparse graphs is due to Whiteley, who proved in [19] that for the range 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ _k −_ 1, the tight graphs
are those that can be decomposed into ℓ edge-disjoint spanning trees and
_k −_ _ℓ_ edge-disjoint maps.

A k-arborescence is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint spanning trees.
Figure 1(a) shows an example of a 3-arborescence. The k-arborescent graphs are described
by the well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] as exactly the (k, _k)-tight_
graphs.
A map-graph is a graph that admits an orientation such that the out-degree of each vertex is
exactly one. A k-map-graph is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint mapgraphs. Figure 1(b) shows an example of a 2-map-graphs; the edges are oriented in one possible
configuration certifying that each color forms a map-graph. Map-graphs may be equivalently
defined (see, e.g., [18]) as having exactly one cycle per connected component.[1]

Content: _The decomposition problem._ We define the decomposition problem for sparse graphs as taking a graph as its input and producing as output, a decomposition that can be used to certify sparsity. In this paper, we will study three kinds of outputs: maps-and-trees; proper ℓTk decompositions;
and the pebble-game-with-colors decomposition, which is defined in the next section.

=== ANSWER ===
The concepts of arboricity and edge-disjoint tree decompositions generalize to k-map constructions in sparse graph theory by considering the decomposition into k edge-disjoint mapgraphs, which are graphs that admit an orientation such that the out-degree of each vertex is exactly one.

In this context, a k-arborescence is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint spanning trees. The k-arborescent graphs are described by the well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] as exactly the (k, k)-tight graphs.

A map-graph is a graph that admits an orientation such that the out-degree of each vertex is exactly one. A k-map-graph is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint mapgraphs. The connection between sparse graphs and decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees has been extensively studied, with classical results showing the equivalence of (k, k)-tight graphs and graphs that can be decomposed into k edge-disjoint spanning trees.

The particular case in which k = 2 and ℓ = 3 has an important application in rigidity theory: the minimally (2, 3)-sparse graphs, known as Laman graphs, correspond to minimally generically rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane [6]. Crapo [1] showed the equivalence of Laman graphs and those graphs that have a decomposition into 3 edge-disjoint trees such that each vertex is incident to exactly 2 of the trees; such a decomposition is called a 3T 2 decomposition.

In summary, the concepts of arboricity and edge-disjoint tree decompositions generalize to k-map constructions in sparse graph theory by considering the decomposition into k edge-disjoint mapgraphs. This generalization provides an analog of the first equivalences in terms of graphs which decompose into k edge-disjoint maps, as shown in [8].
