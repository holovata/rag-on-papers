#### 3. Hadwiger’s Conjecture: Let G be a k-chromatic graph on p points and q lines, p > k. Clearly this graph will always have a minimal-partite- representation, as some k-partite graph. Because, if k is not minimum and suppose there exists subpartite-representation for G as some l-partite graph with l < k, then G will be l-chromatic, a contradiction.  In order to settle Hadwiger’s problem we essentially need to show that for a k-chromatic graph G there exists a well defined sequence of contraction operations to be carried out which will take it to

Content: #### We propose an algorithm to reduce a k-chromatic graph to a complete graph of largest possible order through a well defined sequence of contractions. We introduce a new matrix called transparency matrix and state its properties. We then define correct contraction procedure to be executed to get largest possible complete graph from given connected graph. We finally give a characterization for k-chromatic graph and use it to settle Hadwigers conjecture.

#### We now proceed to see that it should be valid for l . But this is clear since graphs on p points, p = l + k, are either themselves k-chromatic, or are graphs which themselves could be less than k-chromatic but have arrived at by suitable contractions, in the sense of algorithm 5.1, from a graph which was k-chromatic. Such graphs must be those which must contain a suitable contraction in the sense of algorithm 5.1 which when carried out produce graphs isomorphic to some graph among the suitable graphs (to be k-chromatic) for the case with p = k + (l −)1, for if these graphs do not contain a contraction which will produce a graph isomorphic to some graph among the graphs which are suitable (for k-chromaticity) for the case of (l −)1 then G cannot be k-chromatic. 
 Theorem 5.2 (Hadwiger’s Conjecture): Every k-chromatic graph is contractible to K, a complete graph on k points.

=== ANSWER ===
The recursive contraction algorithm for Hadwiger's Conjecture relates to achieving the chromatic number via transformations of k-chromatic graphs through the concept of "transparency matrix" and "contraction operations." 

In essence, the algorithm involves a series of contractions that reduce the graph from its original state to a complete graph on k points. Each contraction operation reduces the size of the transparency matrix by exactly one count.

The key idea is that every k-chromatic graph can be reduced to a complete graph through a sequence of contractions. This process is facilitated by the properties of the transparency matrix, which ensures that each contraction operation leads to a valid and equivalent transformation.

In terms of achieving the chromatic number via transformations of k-chromatic graphs, the recursive contraction algorithm provides a systematic approach to reducing the chromatic number of a graph through a series of contractions. This process can be seen as a way to "contract" or simplify the graph while preserving its essential properties, ultimately leading to a complete graph on k points.

The algorithm's reliance on the transparency matrix and contraction operations highlights the importance of these concepts in understanding the relationship between chromatic number and graph structure. By systematically reducing the graph through contractions, the algorithm provides a powerful tool for analyzing and solving problems related to Hadwiger's Conjecture and chromatic numbers.
