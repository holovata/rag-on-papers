What conditions must be satisfied for a graph to be perfectly Markovian, and how does this affect the construction of k-graphs from a probability distribution?

Content: there are no other independencies present in the probability distribution than those represented
by the graph. This property is called the perfect Markovianity of the probability distribution
with respect to the associated concentration graph. We prove in this paper that this particular
concentration graph, the one associated with a perfect Markov distribution, can be determined
by only conditioning on a limited number of variables. We demonstrate that this number is
equal to the maximum size of the minimal separators in the concentration graph.

Content: #### 4. Conclusion

In this paper we have proved that a concentration graph model can be determined using
a limited number of conditioning variables. The cardinality of this limited subset is
determined by looking at the structure of the undirected graph associated with the
corresponding distribution global Markov property. Certainly the perfect Markovianity
assumption is also needed for our result to be valid. Our result remains true for both
continuous and discrete distributions.
Our result can also be used as a justification of the estimation of graphical models by low-order conditioning such as using the PC algorithm (see Spirtes et al.
(2000), Kalisch and B¨uhlmann (2007), Kjærulff and Madsen (2007)), the 0–1 procedure
(see Friedman et al. (2000) and Wille and B¨uhlman (2006)), or the qp-procedure (see
Castello and Roverato (2006)). Practical applications of these procedures are useful when
the number of observations are far fewer than the number of variables. We first estimate

Content: A concentration graph associated with a random vector is an undirected graph where each
vertex corresponds to one random variable in the vector. The absence of an edge between any
pair of vertices (or variables) is equivalent to full conditional independence between these two
variables given all the other variables. In the multivariate Gaussian case, the absence of an edge
corresponds to a zero coefficient in the precision matrix, which is the inverse of the covariance
matrix.
It is well known that this concentration graph represents some of the conditional independencies in the distribution of the associated random vector. These conditional independencies
correspond to the “separations” or absence of edges in that graph. In this paper we assume that
there are no other independencies present in the probability distribution than those represented
by the graph. This property is called the perfect Markovianity of the probability distribution

Lemma 6. Let (X,G, F ) be a concentration graph model and let P be a probability distribution belonging to F . For m,k ∈ N, let Gm and Gk be two undirected graphs constructed
using (5). If P is perfectly Markov to G and 1 ≤ m ≤ k ≤|V | − 2 then Ek ⊆ Em.

=== ANSWER ===
To determine the conditions for a graph to be perfectly Markovian, we need to satisfy the following property:

For all non-empty subsets A, B, and S of vertices V (where S is not empty), if A separates B from S in G0, then XA ⊥⊥ XB|XS.

In other words, if there is no edge between A and B, and there is an edge between A and S, or between B and S, then the variables XA and XB are independent of each other given all the variables in S.

This property is equivalent to the global Markov property (1) being satisfied in both directions. In other words, if A separates B from S, then XA ⊥⊥ XB|XS, and if there is no edge between A and B, then XA ⊥⊥ XB|XS.

The construction of k-graphs from a probability distribution requires that the graph be perfectly Markovian. This means that the concentration graph model can be determined using a limited number of conditioning variables, which is equal to the maximum size of the minimal separators in the concentration graph.

In other words, if we have a graph G and a probability distribution P belonging to F , then we can construct a k-graph (Gk) from P by removing edges between vertices that are not separated by any subset S of V \ {α,β} for all non-adjacent vertices α and β in V . This process ensures that the resulting graph is perfectly Markovian.

The perfect Markovianity assumption is also necessary for this construction to be valid. In fact, our result remains true for both continuous and discrete distributions.

In summary, a graph is perfectly Markovian if it satisfies the property that A separates B from S in G0 implies XA ⊥⊥ XB|XS. This property is equivalent to the global Markov property being satisfied in both directions, and it requires that the concentration graph model can be determined using a limited number of conditioning variables.
