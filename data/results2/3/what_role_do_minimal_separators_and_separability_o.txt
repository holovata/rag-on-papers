Query:
What role do minimal separators and separability order play in determining the structure of concentration graphs from conditional independence statements?

Context:

Content: (α,β) /∈ E ⇐⇒ Xα ⊥⊥ Xβ | X−αβ,

and if A, B and S are three disjoint non-empty subsets of V

S separates A and B in G ⇐⇒ XA ⊥⊥ XB|XS.

The aim of this paper is to prove the existence of a relationship between the cardinality
of the separators in G and the maximum number of conditioning variables needed to
determine the full conditional independencies in P . We proceed first by defining a new
parameter for undirected graphs, called the “separability order ”. Subsequently we prove
that when we condition on a fixed number of variables equal to this separability order,
the graph that is obtained is exactly the concentration graph.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the definition of this parameter and of some properties thereof. In Section 3, we will define a sequence of undirected graphs constructed due to conditional independencies for a given fixed number
k ∈{0,..., |V | − 2}. More precisely, we define the k-graph Gk = (V,Ek) by

Content: A concentration graph associated with a random vector is an undirected graph where each
vertex corresponds to one random variable in the vector. The absence of an edge between any
pair of vertices (or variables) is equivalent to full conditional independence between these two
variables given all the other variables. In the multivariate Gaussian case, the absence of an edge
corresponds to a zero coefficient in the precision matrix, which is the inverse of the covariance
matrix.
It is well known that this concentration graph represents some of the conditional independencies in the distribution of the associated random vector. These conditional independencies
correspond to the “separations” or absence of edges in that graph. In this paper we assume that
there are no other independencies present in the probability distribution than those represented
by the graph. This property is called the perfect Markovianity of the probability distribution

Content: the associated graphical model is called a concentration graph model (see Lauritzen
(1996)). Dempster (1972) studied concentration graph models for Gaussian distributions under the name of covariance selection or covariance selection models. The absence of an edge between a given pair of vertices (α,β) in the associated graph indicates that the random variable Xα is independent of Xβ given all the other variables
X−αβ = (Xγ,γ ̸= α,β)[′]. These models are very well studied, especially the ones corresponding to Gaussian distributions (see Whittaker (1990), Lauritzen (1996), Edwards
(2000) and, recently, Letac and Massam (2007) and Rajaratnam et al. (2008)). The separation criteria defined on such graphs is a simple separation criteria on undirected graphs:
S ⊆ V separates two disjoint non-empty subsets A and B of V if any path joining a vertex
in A and another in B intersects S.
Other graphical models are represented by graphs with bi-directed edges. These models

Content: concentration graph model G is equal to the k-partial graph G[p]k [as defined in (][6][) when]
k is smaller than the separability order of G, referred to in that paper as the “outer
connectivity of the missing edges”. The result in Theorem 4, however, is based on a
construction of a sequence of nested graphs. It starts from the covariance graph, that is,
G0, the 0-graph, and it becomes stationary and equal to the concentration graph when
the number of conditioning variables is equal to the separability order of the concentration
graph.
In Lemma 8, we show that k-partial graphs and k-graphs are equal when the perfect
Markovianity assumption is satisfied. Next, we give a corollary of Theorem 4. In Corollary 9 we give a condition that allows us to determine the last undirected k-graph in
the sequence of nested graphs obtained due to Theorem 4. This condition is given in
term of the degree two of the k-graphs, not as in Castello and Roverato (2006), where

=== ANSWER ===
The minimal separators and separability order play a crucial role in determining the structure of concentration graphs from conditional independence statements.

In the context of concentration graphs, which represent some of the conditional independencies in the distribution of a random vector, the absence of an edge between two vertices (or variables) indicates that the corresponding variables are independent given all other variables. The separability order is defined as the minimum number of conditioning variables needed to determine full conditional independence.

The paper assumes perfect Markovianity, meaning there are no other independencies present in the probability distribution than those represented by the graph. This assumption leads to the definition of a concentration graph model, which is a type of undirected graph where each vertex corresponds to one random variable in the vector.

The separability order and minimal separators are used to construct a sequence of nested graphs, starting from the covariance graph (0-graph) and ending with the k-graph Gk. The k-graph represents some of the conditional independencies in the distribution of the associated random vector.

In particular, the paper shows that when conditioning on a fixed number of variables equal to the separability order, the resulting graph is exactly the concentration graph. This means that the minimal separators and separability order play a key role in determining the structure of the concentration graph, which represents some of the conditional independencies in the distribution.
