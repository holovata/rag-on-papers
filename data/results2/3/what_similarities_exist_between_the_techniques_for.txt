and the pebble-game-with-colors decomposition, which is defined in the next section.

A graph is (k,ℓ)-sparse if for any non-empty subgraph with m[′] edges and n[′] vertices, m[′] _≤_
_kn[′]_ _−_ _ℓ. We observe that this condition implies that 0 ≤_ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1, and from now on in this
paper we will make this assumption. A sparse graph that has n vertices and exactly kn _−_ _ℓ_ edges
is called tight.
For a graph G = (V, _E), and V_ _[′]_ _⊂_ _V_, we use the notation span(V _[′]) for the number of edges_
in the subgraph induced by V _[′]. In a directed graph, out(V_ _[′]) is the number of edges with the tail_
in V _[′]_ and the head in V −V _[′]; for a subgraph induced by V_ _[′], we call such an edge an out-edge._
There are two important types of subgraphs of sparse graphs. A block is a tight subgraph of
a sparse graph. A component is a maximal block.
Table 1 summarizes the sparse graph terminology used in this paper.

Content: The focus of this paper is decompositions of (k,ℓ)-sparse graphs into edge-disjoint subgraphs
that certify sparsity. We use graph to mean a multigraph, possibly with loops. We say that a
graph is (k,ℓ)-sparse if no subset of n[′] vertices spans more than kn[′] _−_ _ℓ_ edges in the graph; a
(k,ℓ)-sparse graph with kn[′] _−_ _ℓ_ edges is (k,ℓ)-tight. We call the range k ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1 the upper
range of sparse graphs and 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ _k the lower range._
In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for finding decompositions that certify sparsity
in the upper range of ℓ. Our algorithms also apply in the lower range, which was already addressed by [3, 4, 5, 6, 19]. A decomposition certifies the sparsity of a graph if the sparse graphs
and graphs admitting the decomposition coincide.

=== ANSWER ===
The techniques for reducing chromatic graphs to complete graphs and the structural constraints imposed by sparse graph characterizations share similarities in their approach to decomposing complex graphs into simpler components.

In the context of chromatic graphs, reduction to a complete graph involves finding a sequence of contractions that preserve the chromatic number while eliminating edges. Similarly, in sparse graph characterization, decomposition techniques aim to identify subgraphs that certify sparsity by reducing the complexity of the original graph.

Both approaches rely on the concept of "contraction" or "pebble game with colors," where a graph is iteratively reduced by contracting edges or adding pebbles (representing vertices) to create simpler graphs. This process allows for the identification of sparse subgraphs that satisfy specific structural constraints, such as the upper range of ℓ in sparse graphs.

The use of transparency matrices and characterization techniques also shares similarities between the two approaches. Transparency matrices provide a way to track the contraction process and ensure that the resulting graph satisfies certain properties. Characterization techniques, on the other hand, aim to identify patterns or structures within the original graph that can be used to reduce its complexity.

Overall, while the specific details of each approach differ, the underlying principles of decomposition, contraction, and characterization are similar, reflecting a common goal of simplifying complex graphs while preserving essential structural properties.
