and the pebble-game-with-colors decomposition, which is defined in the next section.

=== ANSWER ===
I'd be happy to help summarize the context and explain how matroidal properties are used to define decompositions into spanning trees or maps, as well as their implications for graph rigidity.

In the context of graph theory, a sparse graph is one where every non-empty subgraph on n' vertices has at most kn'-ℓ edges. A tight graph is a specific type of sparse graph where |V| = n and |E| = kn-ℓ. Matroidal properties are used to study these graphs, particularly in the context of bar-and-joint rigidity for frameworks embedded on surfaces.

Decompositions into spanning trees or maps are defined using matroid unions. A map-graph is a graph that admits an out-degree-exactly-one orientation, and a (k,ℓ)-maps-and-trees decomposition is an edge-disjoint union of ℓ trees and (k-ℓ) map-grapahs. The set of tree-pieces of an ℓTk induced on V' ⊂V refers to the pieces of trees in the ℓTk spanned by E(V').

The matroidal properties are used to study these decompositions, particularly in the context of graph rigidity. Graph rigidity refers to the property of a framework being rigid, meaning that it cannot be deformed without changing its shape. The (2, 3)-tight graphs correspond to generically minimally rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane.

The matroid unions are used to show the equivalence of maps-and-trees graphs and tight graphs in the lower range. Additionally, matroid augmenting paths are the basis of the algorithms for the lower range of certain problems.

In summary, the matroidal properties are used to define decompositions into spanning trees or maps, which have implications for graph rigidity. The (2, 3)-tight graphs correspond to generically minimally rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane, and the matroid unions are used to study these decompositions.

The key concepts here include:

* Sparse graphs
* Tight graphs
* Matroidal properties
* Map-graphs
* (k,ℓ)-maps-and-trees decompositions
* Graph rigidity

These concepts are used to study the decomposition of sparse graphs into spanning trees or maps, and their implications for graph rigidity.
