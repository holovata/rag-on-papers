We define and study a canonical class of pebble game constructions, which correspond to
previously studied decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our results provide
a unifying framework for all the previously known special cases, including Nash-WilliamsTutte and [7, 24]. Indeed, in the lower range, canonical pebble game constructions capture the
properties of the augmenting paths used in matroid union and intersection algorithms[5, 6].
Since the sparse graphs in the upper range are not known to be unions or intersections of the
matroids for which there are efficient augmenting path algorithms, these do not easily apply in

It follows that any sparse graph has a pebble game construction.

received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored pebbles generalize and strengthen
the previous results of Lee and Streinu [12] and give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the (k,ℓ)-pebble
game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between pebble game algorithms and previous
sparse graph algorithms by Gabow [5], Gabow and Westermann [6] and Hendrickson [9].

_is (1,_ 0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ℓ _tree-pieces of the (1,_ 0)-sparse

_Proof. Let G be a pebble-game graph. The existence of the k edge-disjoint (1,_ 0)-sparse subgraphs was shown in Lemma 10, and Lemma 11 proves the condition on subgraphs.
For the other direction, we observe that a color ci with ti tree-pieces in a given subgraph can
span at most n − _ti edges; summing over all the colors shows that a graph with a pebble-game_
decomposition must be sparse. Apply Theorem 1 to complete the proof.

I'd be happy to help summarize the context and explain how the pebble game framework can be used to characterize sparse graphs and extend it to k-map decompositions.

**Characterizing Sparse Graphs with Pebble Game Framework**

The pebble game framework is a new characterization of sparse graphs, which coincides with (k,ℓ)-sparse graphs. A graph G is considered (k,ℓ)-sparse if it has 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2k - 1 edges and is sparse in the sense that it can be decomposed into k edge-disjoint subgraphs, each of which is (1,0)-sparse.

The pebble game framework provides a way to construct sparse graphs along with a sparsity-certifying decomposition. This framework is based on a simple graph construction rule that produces a sparse graph and a decomposition that certifies its sparsity.

**Extending to k-Map Decompositions**

The pebble game-with-colors decomposition extends the characterization of sparse graphs to include k-map decompositions. A graph G is considered a pebble-game graph if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs, each of which is (1,0)-sparse, and every subgraph of G contains at least ℓ tree-pieces of the (1,0)-sparse graphs in the decomposition.

The pebble game-with-colors decomposition provides a unifying framework for all previously known special cases, including Nash-Williams-Tutte and [7, 24]. This framework captures the properties of augmenting paths used in matroid union and intersection algorithms, which are not easily applicable to sparse graphs in the upper range.

**Key Lemmas and Theorems**

Several key lemmas and theorems support the characterization of sparse graphs with the pebble game framework. These include:

* Lemma 9: If a graph G is (k,ℓ)-sparse, then a pebble not on {v, w} can be brought to either v or w.
* Theorem 1: A graph G is (k,ℓ)-sparse if and only if it is a pebble-game graph.
* Lemma 10: Monochromatic pebble game subgraphs are (1,0)-sparse.
* Theorem 2: A graph G is a pebble-game graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs such that each is (1,0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ℓ tree-pieces of the (1,0)-sparse graphs in the decomposition.

Overall, the pebble game framework provides a powerful tool for characterizing sparse graphs and extending it to k-map decompositions. This framework has connections with previous sparse graph algorithms and exposes new insights into the properties of sparse graphs.
