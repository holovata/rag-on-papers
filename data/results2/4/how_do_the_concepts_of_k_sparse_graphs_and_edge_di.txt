How do the concepts of (k, ℓ)-sparse graphs and edge-disjoint decompositions relate to the structure of Laman graphs and their applications in rigidity theory?

The connection between sparse graphs and decompositions into edgedisjoint spanning trees has been extensively studied. The classical results
of Tutte [18] and Nash-Williams [11] show the equivalence of (k, k)-tight
graphs and graphs that can be decomposed into k edge-disjoint spanning
trees; such a graph is called a k-arborescence. A theorem of Tay [16,
17] relates such graphs to generic rigidity of bar-and-body structures in
arbitrary dimension.
The particular case in which k = 2 and ℓ = 3 has an important application in rigidity theory: the minimally (2, 3)-sparse graphs, known as Laman
graphs, correspond to minimally generically rigid bar-and-joint frameworks
in the plane [6]. Crapo [1] showed the equivalence of Laman graphs and
those graphs that have a decomposition into 3 edge-disjoint trees such that
each vertex is incident to exactly 2 of the trees; such a decomposition is
called a 3T 2 decomposition.

Our results characterize the graphs which admit a decomposition into k
edge-disjoint maps after adding ℓ edges. Since the focus of this paper is
on the families of matroidal sparse graphs, we assume that 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1
unless otherwise stated.
First we consider the case in which we may add any ℓ edges, including
multiple edges and loops, to G. Let Kn[k,][2][k] be the complete graph on n
vertices with k loops on each vertex and edge multiplicity 2k. It is easily
seen that any sparse graph is a subgraph of Kn[k,][2][k], and we assume this in

A graph is (k,ℓ)-sparse if for any non-empty subgraph with m[′] edges and n[′] vertices, m[′] _≤_
_kn[′]_ _−_ _ℓ. We observe that this condition implies that 0 ≤_ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1, and from now on in this
paper we will make this assumption. A sparse graph that has n vertices and exactly kn _−_ _ℓ_ edges
is called tight.
For a graph G = (V, _E), and V_ _[′]_ _⊂_ _V_, we use the notation span(V _[′]) for the number of edges_
in the subgraph induced by V _[′]. In a directed graph, out(V_ _[′]) is the number of edges with the tail_
in V _[′]_ and the head in V −V _[′]; for a subgraph induced by V_ _[′], we call such an edge an out-edge._
There are two important types of subgraphs of sparse graphs. A block is a tight subgraph of
a sparse graph. A component is a maximal block.
Table 1 summarizes the sparse graph terminology used in this paper.

_1.2. Sparsity-certifying decompositions_

=== ANSWER ===
To summarize, the concepts of (k, ℓ)-sparse graphs and edge-disjoint decompositions are closely related to Laman graphs and their applications in rigidity theory.

Laman graphs are a specific type of minimally (2, 3)-sparse graph that corresponds to minimally generically rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane. These graphs have a unique decomposition property: they can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint trees such that each vertex is incident to exactly 2 of the trees.

The connection between sparse graphs and decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees has been extensively studied, with classical results by Tutte and Nash-Williams showing the equivalence of (k, k)-tight graphs and graphs that can be decomposed into k edge-disjoint spanning trees.

A key theorem, Theorem 1, generalizes this characterization to Laman graphs and shows that they are equivalent to graphs that have a decomposition into ℓ edge-disjoint maps after adding ℓ edges. This theorem also generalizes the results of Haas [3] to the range 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ k − 1.

In addition, Theorem 2 characterizes the graphs for which there are some ℓ edges that can be added to create a k-map, and Theorem 3 shows that these graphs are equivalent to (k, 0)-sparse graphs.

Overall, the relationship between sparse graphs, edge-disjoint decompositions, and Laman graphs is a fundamental one in rigidity theory, with significant implications for the study of bar-and-joint frameworks and their generic rigidity.
