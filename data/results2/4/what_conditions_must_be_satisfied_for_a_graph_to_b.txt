Content: there are no other independencies present in the probability distribution than those represented
by the graph. This property is called the perfect Markovianity of the probability distribution

concentration graph, the one associated with a perfect Markov distribution, can be determined
by only conditioning on a limited number of variables. We demonstrate that this number is
equal to the maximum size of the minimal separators in the concentration graph.

Content: #### 4. Conclusion

In this paper we have proved that a concentration graph model can be determined using
a limited number of conditioning variables. The cardinality of this limited subset is
determined by looking at the structure of the undirected graph associated with the
corresponding distribution global Markov property. Certainly the perfect Markovianity
assumption is also needed for our result to be valid. Our result remains true for both
continuous and discrete distributions.
Our result can also be used as a justification of the estimation of graphical models by low-order conditioning such as using the PC algorithm (see Spirtes et al.
(2000), Kalisch and B¨uhlmann (2007), Kjærulff and Madsen (2007)), the 0–1 procedure
(see Friedman et al. (2000) and Wille and B¨uhlman (2006)), or the qp-procedure (see
Castello and Roverato (2006)). Practical applications of these procedures are useful when
the number of observations are far fewer than the number of variables. We first estimate

Content: A concentration graph associated with a random vector is an undirected graph where each
vertex corresponds to one random variable in the vector. The absence of an edge between any
pair of vertices (or variables) is equivalent to full conditional independence between these two
variables given all the other variables. In the multivariate Gaussian case, the absence of an edge
corresponds to a zero coefficient in the precision matrix, which is the inverse of the covariance
matrix.
It is well known that this concentration graph represents some of the conditional independencies in the distribution of the associated random vector. These conditional independencies
correspond to the “separations” or absence of edges in that graph. In this paper we assume that
there are no other independencies present in the probability distribution than those represented
by the graph. This property is called the perfect Markovianity of the probability distribution

=== ANSWER ===
I'd be happy to help summarize the context for you.

To determine if a graph is perfectly Markovian, two conditions must be satisfied:

1. The global Markov property (global independence) holds: For any triple of disjoint non-empty subsets (A,B,S), where S is not empty, A is independent of B given S.
2. The converse of the global Markov property also holds: If A is independent of B given S, then XA is independent of XB given XS.

In other words, if a graph represents all the conditional independencies in a probability distribution, and the converse of the global independence property holds, then the graph is perfectly Markovian.

This assumption is crucial for constructing k-graphs from a probability distribution. A k-graph is an undirected graph where each vertex corresponds to one random variable in the vector. The absence of an edge between any pair of vertices represents full conditional independence between those two variables given all the other variables.

The paper assumes that there are no other independencies present in the probability distribution than those represented by the graph, which is called perfect Markovianity. This property allows for the construction of k-graphs using a limited number of conditioning variables, determined by looking at the structure of the undirected graph associated with the global Markov property.

In summary, perfect Markovianity is a necessary condition for constructing k-graphs from a probability distribution, and it ensures that the graph represents all the conditional independencies in the distribution.
