What role do minimal separators and separability order play in determining the structure of concentration graphs from conditional independence statements?

Content: (α,β) /∈ E ⇐⇒ Xα ⊥⊥ Xβ | X−αβ,

and if A, B and S are three disjoint non-empty subsets of V

S separates A and B in G ⇐⇒ XA ⊥⊥ XB|XS.

The aim of this paper is to prove the existence of a relationship between the cardinality
of the separators in G and the maximum number of conditioning variables needed to
determine the full conditional independencies in P . We proceed first by defining a new
parameter for undirected graphs, called the “separability order ”. Subsequently we prove
that when we condition on a fixed number of variables equal to this separability order,
the graph that is obtained is exactly the concentration graph.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the definition of this parameter and of some properties thereof. In Section 3, we will define a sequence of undirected graphs constructed due to conditional independencies for a given fixed number
k ∈{0,..., |V | − 2}. More precisely, we define the k-graph Gk = (V,Ek) by

Content: A concentration graph associated with a random vector is an undirected graph where each
vertex corresponds to one random variable in the vector. The absence of an edge between any
pair of vertices (or variables) is equivalent to full conditional independence between these two
variables given all the other variables. In the multivariate Gaussian case, the absence of an edge
corresponds to a zero coefficient in the precision matrix, which is the inverse of the covariance
matrix.
It is well known that this concentration graph represents some of the conditional independencies in the distribution of the associated random vector. These conditional independencies
correspond to the “separations” or absence of edges in that graph. In this paper we assume that
there are no other independencies present in the probability distribution than those represented
by the graph. This property is called the perfect Markovianity of the probability distribution

Content: the associated graphical model is called a concentration graph model (see Lauritzen
(1996)). Dempster (1972) studied concentration graph models for Gaussian distributions under the name of covariance selection or covariance selection models. The absence of an edge between a given pair of vertices (α,β) in the associated graph indicates that the random variable Xα is independent of Xβ given all the other variables
X−αβ = (Xγ,γ ̸= α,β)[′]. These models are very well studied, especially the ones corresponding to Gaussian distributions (see Whittaker (1990), Lauritzen (1996), Edwards
(2000) and, recently, Letac and Massam (2007) and Rajaratnam et al. (2008)). The separation criteria defined on such graphs is a simple separation criteria on undirected graphs:
S ⊆ V separates two disjoint non-empty subsets A and B of V if any path joining a vertex
in A and another in B intersects S.
Other graphical models are represented by graphs with bi-directed edges. These models

Content: concentration graph model G is equal to the k-partial graph G[p]k [as defined in (][6][) when]
k is smaller than the separability order of G, referred to in that paper as the “outer
connectivity of the missing edges”. The result in Theorem 4, however, is based on a
construction of a sequence of nested graphs. It starts from the covariance graph, that is,
G0, the 0-graph, and it becomes stationary and equal to the concentration graph when
the number of conditioning variables is equal to the separability order of the concentration
graph.
In Lemma 8, we show that k-partial graphs and k-graphs are equal when the perfect
Markovianity assumption is satisfied. Next, we give a corollary of Theorem 4. In Corollary 9 we give a condition that allows us to determine the last undirected k-graph in
the sequence of nested graphs obtained due to Theorem 4. This condition is given in
term of the degree two of the k-graphs, not as in Castello and Roverato (2006), where

To summarize, the paper explores the relationship between minimal separators, separability order, and concentration graphs in conditional independence statements. Concentration graphs are undirected graphs where each vertex represents a random variable, and the absence of an edge between two vertices indicates full conditional independence between those variables given all others.

The concept of separability order is introduced as a new parameter for undirected graphs, which plays a crucial role in determining the structure of concentration graphs. The paper aims to prove that when conditioning on a fixed number of variables equal to the separability order, the resulting graph is exactly the concentration graph.

Minimal separators and separability order are essential in understanding how conditional independence statements affect the structure of concentration graphs. Separators are sets of vertices that separate two disjoint subsets of vertices in a graph, while separability order refers to the minimum number of conditioning variables needed to determine full conditional independencies in a probability distribution.

The paper defines a sequence of undirected graphs (k-graphs) constructed based on conditional independence statements for a fixed number k. The k-graph is defined as the 0-graph, and subsequent graphs are obtained by adding edges according to certain rules. The separability order of the concentration graph determines the maximum number of conditioning variables needed to determine full conditional independencies.

In summary, minimal separators and separability order play a vital role in determining the structure of concentration graphs from conditional independence statements. The paper explores the relationship between these concepts and provides a framework for understanding how they affect the structure of concentration graphs.
