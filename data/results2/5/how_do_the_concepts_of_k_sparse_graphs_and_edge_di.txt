The connection between sparse graphs and decompositions into edgedisjoint spanning trees has been extensively studied. The classical results
of Tutte [18] and Nash-Williams [11] show the equivalence of (k, k)-tight
graphs and graphs that can be decomposed into k edge-disjoint spanning
trees; such a graph is called a k-arborescence. A theorem of Tay [16,
17] relates such graphs to generic rigidity of bar-and-body structures in
arbitrary dimension.
The particular case in which k = 2 and ℓ = 3 has an important application in rigidity theory: the minimally (2, 3)-sparse graphs, known as Laman
graphs, correspond to minimally generically rigid bar-and-joint frameworks
in the plane [6]. Crapo [1] showed the equivalence of Laman graphs and
those graphs that have a decomposition into 3 edge-disjoint trees such that
each vertex is incident to exactly 2 of the trees; such a decomposition is
called a 3T 2 decomposition.

can be added to create a k-map.

Content: ### 2 Our Results

Our results characterize the graphs which admit a decomposition into k
edge-disjoint maps after adding ℓ edges. Since the focus of this paper is
on the families of matroidal sparse graphs, we assume that 0 ≤ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1
unless otherwise stated.
First we consider the case in which we may add any ℓ edges, including
multiple edges and loops, to G. Let Kn[k,][2][k] be the complete graph on n
vertices with k loops on each vertex and edge multiplicity 2k. It is easily
seen that any sparse graph is a subgraph of Kn[k,][2][k], and we assume this in

Content: _1.1. Sparse graphs_

A graph is (k,ℓ)-sparse if for any non-empty subgraph with m[′] edges and n[′] vertices, m[′] _≤_
_kn[′]_ _−_ _ℓ. We observe that this condition implies that 0 ≤_ _ℓ_ _≤_ 2k − 1, and from now on in this
paper we will make this assumption. A sparse graph that has n vertices and exactly kn _−_ _ℓ_ edges
is called tight.
For a graph G = (V, _E), and V_ _[′]_ _⊂_ _V_, we use the notation span(V _[′]) for the number of edges_
in the subgraph induced by V _[′]. In a directed graph, out(V_ _[′]) is the number of edges with the tail_
in V _[′]_ and the head in V −V _[′]; for a subgraph induced by V_ _[′], we call such an edge an out-edge._
There are two important types of subgraphs of sparse graphs. A block is a tight subgraph of
a sparse graph. A component is a maximal block.
Table 1 summarizes the sparse graph terminology used in this paper.

_1.2. Sparsity-certifying decompositions_

=== ANSWER ===
Let's break down the concepts of (k, ℓ)-sparse graphs and edge-disjoint decompositions, and how they relate to Laman graphs and their applications in rigidity theory.

**What are (k, ℓ)-sparse graphs?**

A graph is considered (k, ℓ)-sparse if it meets a certain condition. Imagine you have a graph with k loops on each vertex (like a bunch of rubber bands tied around each point). If you add ℓ edges to the graph, and for any subgraph (a smaller version of the original graph) with m edges and n vertices, the number of edges in that subgraph is less than or equal to kn - ℓ. This condition ensures that the graph doesn't have too many edges compared to its size.

**What are edge-disjoint decompositions?**

An edge-disjoint decomposition means breaking down a graph into smaller parts (called maps) without sharing any edges between them. Think of it like cutting a pizza into slices, where each slice is a separate part of the original pizza.

**How do Laman graphs relate to edge-disjoint decompositions?**

Laman graphs are special types of (k, ℓ)-sparse graphs that have an important application in rigidity theory. They correspond to minimally generically rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane. In other words, if you add 3 edges to a Laman graph, it becomes a k-map (a type of decomposition).

**The connection between sparse graphs and edge-disjoint decompositions**

There's a fascinating relationship between sparse graphs and edge-disjoint decompositions. Theorems by Tutte, Nash-Williams, and Tay show that certain types of sparse graphs can be decomposed into edge-disjoint spanning trees. This means that if you have a graph with k loops on each vertex (like our rubber band example), it can be broken down into smaller parts without sharing any edges.

**The significance of Laman graphs**

Laman graphs are special because they correspond to minimally generically rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane. This means that if you add 3 edges to a Laman graph, it becomes a k-map (a type of decomposition). Theorems by Crapo and others show that Laman graphs are equivalent to certain types of edge-disjoint decompositions.

**What does this mean for rigidity theory?**

The connection between sparse graphs, edge-disjoint decompositions, and Laman graphs has important implications for rigidity theory. It helps us understand how certain types of bar-and-joint frameworks can be made rigid (i.e., resistant to deformation) by adding specific edges.

In summary, the concepts of (k, ℓ)-sparse graphs and edge-disjoint decompositions are closely related to Laman graphs and their applications in rigidity theory. By understanding these relationships, we can gain insights into how certain types of bar-and-joint frameworks can be made rigid, which has important implications for fields like engineering and architecture.
